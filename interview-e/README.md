# Interview Exercise E

This technical interview project is suited for a web developer role.

Your goal is to create a customized, looping carousel using a mix of html, scss, and vanilla javascript.

We've included some basic frontend tooling with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and preinstalled the latest Bootstrap to help jump start the assignment. Not included is any actual code from the site.

While this carousel matches our branding, we want to be clear that is not spec work and your code will not be used for anything else than this interview.

## Goals
- Determine your level of frontend development ability
- Identify your areas of strength

## Instructions

**This should take about an hour.**

You are welcome to use any libraries or packages in addition to bootstrap and scss.

### The Scenario:

Our designer has a new carousel they've designed for use on the homepage of our site.
You will be provided with access to a figma file containing a slider meant for use on a CMS-based website (not a js app). Your task is to create the html/scss/js markup for the new feature.

- Carousel should match the Figma at three breakpoints
- Asset exporting has been left to your discretion.
- We provided some very basic scaffolding. Feel free to add to it and adjust as needed
- Consider how interactions might occur on a touch screen vs standard keyboard / mouse
- Consider best practices in regard to SEO and accessibility.

## Developer Setup

This code was assembled with Node 16. It may work on earlier, but if all else fails, be sure to run from 16.

## Running the Code

From the root directory, run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Good luck!
