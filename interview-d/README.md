# Interview D

## Goals

- Determine your ability to read and understand code
- Identify your areas of strength

## Resources

For this activity, you'll need to have a basic understanding of how Typescript and JSON work. If you're unfamiliar with either of these languages, you can explore the following documentation:

- **Typescript:** https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html
- **JSON:** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON

## Survey Activity Instructions

You have received a request from a customer to build them a survey! They sent a flow chart of how they would like the survey to look and interact.

1. Spend some time examining the flow chart in flowchart.jpg. You'll notice that this chart is color-coded.

   - **Questions** = Orange | Teal
   - **Answers** = Black | No background

   You'll also notice that some questions contain text that are in parentheses. These are hints for how the survey should behave. They are not intended for the customer to see in their actual survey!

2. Spend some time examining the survey template we have provided in survey-template.ts. This file is broken down into three main steps:

   - **Questions Section** -- this is where we define the survey question/answers and any behaviors
   - **End Screen Section** -- this is where we decide how a survey should end
   - **Steps Section** -- this is where we decide which order the questions should be asked we decide which order the questions should be asked

   There's additional context in each section as well some guiding questions to think through.

3. In your-solution.ts, using the flowchart and survey template as a guide, build out the survey the customer requested!

## Additional Notes

We understand that everyone learns in different ways! If you're comfortable with Typescript and you find it helpful to have types defined, you can refer to types.ts to understand the data structure for each part of the survey. If you find this to be confusing or simply don't have enough time, that's okay! Feel free to leave that part out of your solution and ignore that file.
